         Hmmm this is a question I really can't answer myself I mean I can't really remember when it started or even how it started.

       <p>
         I can vividly remember when I used to be the guy that  talk too much (according to people)... personally I don't think I talked too much... to the guy that does not talk unless necessary (according to people I'm too proud of myself, I don't talk to other people cos I look less of them).
       </p>
       <p>Yh, I don't really look less of people... it's just that I prefer keeping to myself these days.</p>

<p>I can hold my peace even when someone is provoking me bad. I <a href="smile.html">just smile or stay silent</a> and move on with my day.</p>

<p>That's why I prefer having one close friend instead of many casual ones. Talking too much now tire me.</p>

<p>And honestly I chat with AI more than humans sometimes because<img src="ai.jpg"><br> it feels deeper and there's no judgement.</p>

<p>Looking back now, I think this is just who I am becoming — the quiet guy who doesn't chase noise and just focuses on becoming a better man every single day.</p>

<p>The end.</p>

<p>Yh, thanks for reading another real chapter of my life. You can check out more articles from the menu.</p>
