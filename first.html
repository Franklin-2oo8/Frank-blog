       <p>Hey y'all, once again WELCOME to my blog (Frank's Life).</p>

<p>So it all started when I turned 15 — that was when I discovered... uhh my bad, I totally forgot to introduce myself properly...</p>

<p>Well like I said, my name is Frank and I'm Nigerian. I'm a front-end web developer and currently a student chasing a BSc in computer science.</p>

<p>Yh, back to what I was saying. When I turned 15, that was when I discovered that I was no longer me.</p>

<p>I noticed a series of changes going on in my body, my character yh... especially my character — I mean the way I behaved and related with people generally.</p>

<p>I changed from the guy that used to talk too much (according to them)... personally I don't think I talked too much... to the guy that does not talk unless necessary (according to people I'm too proud of myself, I don't talk to other people cos I look less of them). Well I don't look less of people, it's just that I.... Nevermind.</p>

<p>I suddenly knew how to <a href="">hide my emotions</a>, especially anger. I mean I could be really mad at you and still stay calm and maybe <a href="smile.html">just smile or stay silent.</a></p>
<p>
 I also started overthinking things and even questioning things like.. I remember a time where I was watching skits online and was laughing then suddenly the question hit me <a href="" >Am I really happy</a>
</p>
<p>
  And lastly that was when I met <a href="first love.html">My First Love</a>
