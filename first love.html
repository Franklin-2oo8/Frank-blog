       <p>Hmmm, she looked like she was not of this world in anyway. I hadn't seen anyone as beautiful in my entire life... is she from this world? Is she an angel?</p>
       <p>Hey Frank my friend tapped me then I realized I had been staring for too long.</p>
       <p>She's not that pretty, I'm the one over-hyping her, I said in my head (trying to tap back to reality).</p>
       <p>Ohh, her name is Faith and I met her on the first day at my new school.</p>
       <p>Throughout the morning lectures I just couldn't help staring at her.</p>
       <p>The first class came to an end and our class teacher said the class prefect should write a list of noise makers. It was then I realized she was the class prefect.</p>
       <p>So I didn't really care about the list of noise makers going on. I was talking with some friends I made already during the summer coaching period. I noticed she looked my way, then she walked up to me and asked my name (come on man, this is not real, my crush seems to notice me). I told her my name and she smiled and told me her name too.</p>
       <p>Fast forward to when the class teacher asked for the list... The teacher called my name (then it dawned on me that she only asked for my name to get it in the list). I looked her way and our eyes locked... she looked away but I just smiled.</p>
       <p>After then I just ignored her almost completely until fate brought us back... she was moved by the teacher to my seat for no good reason.</p>
       <p>For the first few weeks sitting together we didn't really talk much unless necessary...</p>
       <p>Then after the next few weeks, I don't know what happened — we got real close. <img src="my first love.jpg"/><br>My friends started thinking we were secondary school secret lovers. After some time, part of the class started taunting us.</p>
       <p>To conclude the long story, we stayed very close till we graduated from secondary school... and I never told her I liked her or asked her to be my girlfriend.</p>
       <p>Even now, I still don't fully understand why I never said anything. Maybe that's just how I am — the quiet guy who holds his peace.</p>
       <p>The end.</p>
